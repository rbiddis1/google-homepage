This is a new repo on github for use with the Odin Project.

From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/html-css)

## About Me

Learning more about HTML and CSS. Also learning more about DevTools.

This is the 2nd time I've started this. Trying to get it done this time.

I actually had a harder time but I learned more this time.
